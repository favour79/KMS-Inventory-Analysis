### üì¶ Question 5: KMS incurred the most shipping cost using which shipping method?

**Answer:**  
Based on the analysis of the shipping cost across all orders, the **Delivery Truck** shipping method accounted for the highest total shipping cost.

| Shipping Method | Total Shipping Cost (‚Ç¶) |
|-----------------|--------------------------|
| Delivery Truck  | ‚Ç¶51,971.94               |

**üîç Insight:**  
This suggests that although the Delivery Truck option may be more affordable per shipment or suitable for bulk deliveries, it is also the most frequently used and has accumulated the highest cost overall.

**‚úÖ Recommendation:**  
KMS should assess the cost-effectiveness of using Delivery Trucks by reviewing:
- Whether the deliveries justify the cost (e.g., bulk orders).
- If certain routes or regions consistently incur higher charges.
- Opportunities to renegotiate logistics contracts or optimize routing for better cost savings.
