### Question 10: Which customer returned items, and what segment do they belong to?

**Analysis Limitation:**

The provided dataset does not contain any column or flag indicating whether an item was returned (e.g., `is_returned`, `return_status`, or similar). Therefore, it is not possible to determine which customers returned items or to associate returns with specific customer segments based on the current data.

**Recommendation:**

To analyze return behaviors in future projects, it is recommended that the sales data include a return status column. This will enable the business to track:
- Return rates by product or category
- Customer segments with the highest return frequency
- Operational or logistics issues contributing to returns
