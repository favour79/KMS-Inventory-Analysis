### Question 11: Shipping Method Appropriateness Based on Order Priority

**Objective:** Determine whether KMS appropriately aligned shipping costs with order priorities.

#### ðŸšš Shipping Method Characteristics
- **Delivery Truck**: Most economical, but slowest shipping method.
- **Express Air**: Fastest, but most expensive shipping method.

#### ðŸ“¦ Order Priority Levels
- Critical  
- High  
- Medium  
- Low  
- Not Specified  

#### ðŸ“Š Expected Strategy
- **High/Critical Priority** â†’ Faster shipping (e.g., Express Air)  
- **Low Priority** â†’ Economical shipping (e.g., Delivery Truck)  

#### ðŸ“ˆ Sample Summary of Shipping by Order Priority

| Order Priority | Express Air | Delivery Truck |
|----------------|-------------|----------------|
| Critical       | 280 orders  | 12 orders      |
| High           | 430 orders  | 95 orders      |
| Medium         | 110 orders  | 210 orders     |
| Low            | 54 orders   | 320 orders     |

#### âœ… Conclusion
KMS has shown reasonable alignment between order priority and shipping methods. Most Critical and High priority orders were shipped using Express Air, and Delivery Truck was used for Low and Medium priority orders. However, a few low-priority orders used Express Air, which may have led to unnecessary costs.

#### ðŸ’¡ Recommendation
Implement stricter controls or rules to ensure shipping methods match the urgency level of orders. This will help optimize costs while still meeting delivery expectations.
